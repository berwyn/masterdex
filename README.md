=========

## Grokking Go, in style

The purpose of this project is twofold:

  1. Learn Go by building something more than a trivial project
  2. Build an API for future projects

(You could also say that this is where I'm sallying forth into the world of BDD as well)

## Running the application

[!TODO] Describe the required environment variables to configure the app

```bash
go install github.com/berwyn/masterdex
masterdex
```
